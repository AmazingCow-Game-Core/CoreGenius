====
Made with <3 by [Amazing Cow](http://www.amazingcow.com).

## Intro:
This is a Game Core for Genius Game.   
You can use it as a "lib" for making Genius Game in C++ concentrating 
your efforts in making a cool game interface and letting the logic of the 
game alone.


## Files:
We tried to separated the files in a very organized form.   
Here is a list of them:

* ```CoreGenius.h```
* ```CoreGenius_Utils.h```
* ```GameCore.h```

## More info:
We tried to document the Core extensively, so we think that is pretty ease to 
get what the Core is doing,the API calls and stuff.   
Anyway if you didn't understand something let us know sending a mail to
